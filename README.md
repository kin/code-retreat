# Kin Code Retreat Template

Welcome! This repo will quickly get you started with writing tests and solving some katas!

# Setup

`yarn install`

# Execution

We can utilize Jest's watcher to enable a much faster testing experience.

`yarn test`

Any code changes will now rerun the tests!

# Conways Game of Life Rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
